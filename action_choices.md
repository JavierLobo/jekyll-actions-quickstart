Where to find Jekyll actions on Github.

## Starter workflows

If you create a new action through the Actions tab, you'll see a Jekyll action there. You might have to click a _more..._ button.

That references this file:

[jekyll.yml](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/master/ci/jekyll.yml) in the [actions/starter-workflows](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows) repo.

It does provide any info though on what you do after a successful build in terms of publishing and viewing results.


## Helaili

See this action:

- Jekyll Actions
    - [Jekyll Actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jekyll-actions) on Marketplace.
    - [helaili/jekyll-action](https://github.com/helaili/jekyll-action) repo by [helaili](https://github.com/helaili), a staff member at Github.

The instructions on the Marketplace page are the same as on the repo README.md and are a good intro.
