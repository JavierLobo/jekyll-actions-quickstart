Use Github's Actions functionality as a deploy pipeline which gives a lot more control than the standard Github Pages deploy.

You can run any gem you want even if it not supported by Github Pages.

Including:

- Jekyll 4
- Plugins
- Themes

Note, even if a plugin or themes written for Jekyll 3 installs and runs without error in Jekyll 4, you may still run into issues. For example, overwrite a theme layout in your project so that you can control the URLs.

See the [Upgrading from 3x to 4x](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/upgrading/3-to-4/) guide to see what changes there are.
