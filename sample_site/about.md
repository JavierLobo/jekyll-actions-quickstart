Use Github's Actions functionality as a deploy pipeline which gives a lot more control than the standard Github Pages deploy.

Actions means you can do the following that you can't on Github Pages:

- Set custom Jekyll version.
- Use custom themes (not with the 10 or so that Github provides).
- Use custom plugins.

Note that some Jekyll themes are not compatible with new Jekyll versions.

e.g. `jekyll-theme-architect` needs `jekyll (~> 3.3)`.
